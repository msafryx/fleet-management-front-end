      # --- Documentation Rules ---
      - Do not generate or modify Markdown (.md) documentation files unless explicitly requested by the user.
      - Avoid creating README.md, CHANGELOG.md, or CONTRIBUTING.md automatically.
      - Focus responses only on source code, not documentation.

      # --- Code Quality & Logic ---
      - Always produce code with solid, production-grade logic.
      - Ensure code readability and maintainability without redundant comments.
      - Extract common form logic into custom hooks.
      - Consolidate duplicate table components to reduce code repetition.
      - Centralize API call logic in a single utility or service layer once backend integration exists.
      - Use modular, reusable components across the project.
