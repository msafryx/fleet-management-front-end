## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ 
- npm

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd fleet-management-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables** (optional for development)
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your configuration
   ```

4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Mock Login Credentials

For demo purposes, you can use any email/password combination:

- **Admin Access:** Select "Admin" role
- **Employee Access:** Select "Employee" role

## 📦 Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server with Turbopack
npm run build    # Build for production with Turbopack
npm run start    # Start production server
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```

## 🔐 Authentication

### Current State: Development Mode

The application currently uses **client-side mock authentication** suitable only for development and demos.

**Features:**
- ✅ Mock login functionality
- ✅ Role-based UI (Admin/Employee)
- ✅ Client-side route protection
- ✅ Session persistence (localStorage)

**Limitations:**
- ❌ NOT secure for production
- ❌ No server-side validation
- ❌ No real user database

### Production Deployment

For production deployment with real authentication:

1. **Read the authentication guide:** [docs/AUTHENTICATION.md](./docs/AUTHENTICATION.md)
2. **Integrate Keycloak or another IDP** following the provided guide
3. **Enable server-side middleware** for route protection
4. **Configure proper session management**

See [README.AUTH.md](./README.AUTH.md) for quick reference.
